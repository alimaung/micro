# Untrack folder in Git repository (2025-10-27 17:49Z)

_**User (2025-10-27 07:39Z)**_

how to untrack a folder like this

C:\Users\RAVEN\Desktop\micro\micro\microapp\migrations\__pycache__

already added __pycache__ to gitignore, but still here

I can help you untrack that `__pycache__` folder. When you add something to `.gitignore`, it only prevents Git from tracking new files, but doesn't remove files that are already being tracked. You need to explicitly remove them from Git's index first.

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: .gitignore

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**
