## Key findings

### 1. Detection method differences are small
- Edge-Based (current): 16,918 pages (0.81%)
- Smart-Fit: 20,533 pages (0.98%)
- Difference: 3,615 pages (0.17% of total)

All methods flag under 1% of pages, and the gap is small. The current Edge-Based method is conservative and appears appropriate.

### 2. Page size distribution
- A4: 85.7% (1,798,754 pages) — dominant
- Letter: 8.4% (176,630 pages)
- Custom: 4.6% (96,754 pages) — worth investigating
- A0: 0.6% (12,576 pages) — very large
- A3: 0.4% (8,064 pages) — threshold size

### 3. Notable edge cases
- 33.1×46.8 (A0): 12,383 pages — should be oversized
- 8.3×21.0: 2,218 pages — tall/scroll format
- 23.4×33.1 (A1): 298 pages — should be oversized

### 4. Business impact
Switching to Smart-Fit would flag ~3,615 more pages. At ~690 pages per 35mm roll, that’s roughly 5–6 additional rolls.

## Recommendations

1. Keep Edge-Based (current) if:
   - The 0.17% difference is acceptable
   - You want to minimize 35mm usage
   - The current logic handles your needs

2. Consider Smart-Fit if:
   - You want to catch edge cases like rotated pages
   - The cost of ~5–6 additional rolls is acceptable
   - You want more consistent detection

3. Investigate the Custom size category (96,754 pages) to understand what’s being missed.

## Conclusion
The current Edge-Based method is performing well. The differences between methods are small, suggesting the detection logic is sound. The decision to switch should be based on whether catching the additional 0.17% of pages is worth the extra cost.

Should I analyze the Custom size pages or compare specific edge cases?
