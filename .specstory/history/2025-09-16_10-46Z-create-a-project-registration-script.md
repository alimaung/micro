# Create a project registration script (2025-09-16 10:46Z)

_**User (2025-09-16 10:46Z)**_

can you create a one time script/command that registers all the rest/available projects/folders in X?

so similar like analyze, but it should also register the projects and do all the registration steps.

@analyze_service.py 

@project_manager.py 

first confirm to me what you understand and which registration steps should be made

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Confirming registration steps**

I need to start by confirming my understanding of the user’s request for a one-time script that registers all remaining available projects and folders in X. It’s similar to analyze, but with additional registration steps. They referenced analyze_service.py and project_manager.py. I’ll outline those steps: from analysis to preconditions, then the actual registration, creating project entries, potentially linking to AnalyzedFolder, and ensuring the .data directory is created. I’ll also need to dig into the codebase to find the registration flow and specific steps.
**Confirming environment and registration methods**

I need to confirm the environment path on Windows as X:\. The analyze_service has useful methods like discovering unregistered folders and analyzing folders on their own. The registration method focuses on several baseline fields, such as archive_id, location, and project_path. After registration, I think we might need to process the project or create a film allocation. I’ll investigate the project_manager to see how it handles project creation, and I’ll also check the models to understand the required fields. Time for some codebase searches!</details></think>

---

I'll scan the codebase to identify the existing registration flow, models involved (e.g., Project, AnalyzedFolder), and any steps that should be executed automatically so I can confirm the exact registration steps before implementing the script.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Running grep patterns**

I’m thinking about running parallel grep for several terms, like "register," "register_" commands, "project_path," "pdf_folder_path," and "retail_sources"—maybe I should check "retain_sources" as well. I also want to include "register as project." Using multi_tool_use.parallel with these grep calls sounds like a good plan. This approach could help me gather the needed information more efficiently!</details></think>

---

I'll search the codebase for the registration flow, related views/commands, and the Project model to enumerate the exact steps.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Self-correcting tool usage**

I've encountered some errors with tool calls, and I missed including a status update, which is required. The user wants to create a one-time script to register all available projects and folders in X, similar to the analyze function but encompassing all registration steps. They’re also asking for confirmation of my understanding and the registration steps involved. The provided analyze_service.py contains methods that will help summarize these steps clearly for the user's request.
**Identifying registration steps**

I'm looking at the methods in ProjectManager that will help create and process projects. The registration steps seem to include discovering folders in X while excluding some directories and those already registered. Then, I would analyze each folder to determine documents and workflows, creating or updating the AnalyzedFolder records.

Next, I'll register a new project using the analyzed folder's data, mapping it to necessary fields. After that, the process project function might need document data, but I need to check if any parse steps are overlooked for JSON files. It seems that previous tool calls faced issues due to path mismatches, so I need to ensure that’s addressed as well.
**Addressing tool path issues**

I'm figuring out the default workspace path, which is set to Y:\micro. For the grep path parameter, it needs to be relative, so "micro/microapp" should work. However, it seems I'm getting an error telling me that it can't find "microapp." Maybe it's due to how I quoted the path? I thought I passed "micro/microapp," but the error suggests it only saw "microapp." 

I need to check the attached files and also read models.py, roll_manager.py, and film_number_manager.py to confirm the required fields and processes. I'll use multi_tool_use.parallel to read these files together efficiently.
**Planning the next steps**

My plan is to provide a status update before running parallel reads of the necessary files. Next, I'll confirm the steps to the user, focusing on a one-time command. The user wants confirmation, not implementation just yet, but I understand we need to keep moving until their query is fully resolved.

I'm thinking of proposing a Django management command that iterates through unregistered folders using AnalyzeService. Then, for each folder, I'd analyze it and construct the project data by deriving elements like archive_id and doc_type, possibly from the folder name or the microfilmProjectState.json file. However, since discover_unregistered_folders excludes those with `.data`, I might need to reassess the context.
**Clarifying registration needs**

The analyze method gives results like 'recommended_workflow' and 'pdf_folder_path,' but it doesn't return 'archive_id' or 'location.' For registration, I need to decide how to derive these. Parsing folder names might work, but the analyze function excludes those starting with "RRD9." I could set defaults for archive_id based on folder names and a common location like '105.'

The user likely wants to register any unregistered folder, so I'll clarify registration steps, including creating a Project record and processing rolls. To confirm the required Project fields, I'll read models.py and use a parallel read for the relevant files.</details></think>

---

I'll open the key modules to confirm how Projects are registered and which steps are required: the `Project` model, and the `roll_manager` and `film_number_manager` services used during registration/processing.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating project registration steps**

The analyze service has a method for registering an analyzed folder as a project, which requires project data like project path, folder name, and ownership details. I need to confirm which fields come from the UI. Likely steps include generating index data, creating rolls, and updating statuses. I consider proposing a Django management command that scans a specific drive for unregistered folders, analyzes them, registers each as a project, and optionally runs a process to allocate film numbers. But there's uncertainty regarding the availability of a JSON file from the analysis service.
**Clarifying registration steps**

The request is to confirm my understanding and the necessary registration steps. I plan to outline the steps, starting with scanning the top-level directories on X:\, making sure to exclude certain ones. I need to check if folders aren't registered or analyzed, analyze each one, and build a registration structure using derived fields like archive_id and location from the folder name. However, there seems to be inconsistency between the fields required for project creation and those for registration in different models, which I need to clarify further.
**Outlining registration steps**

The registration steps from the regular flow may involve creating a project with essential details like archive_id, location, and project paths, and setting an owner. I’m unsure if I should create a `.data` directory since it’s not in the code. There might also be actions related to analysis or index generation. The user wants to complete the registration process rather than just analyze. I’ll suggest a management command called `register_all_projects` with various options to help manage this. I'll confirm these steps with the user to ensure accuracy.
**Discovering candidate folders**

First, I’ll discover candidate folders in `X:\` using the same rules as `AnalyzeService.discover_unregistered_folders`, which means excluding certain directories and hidden files. For each folder I find, I’ll normalize the path and check the `AnalyzedFolder` table for existing analyses. If it hasn't been analyzed or needs reanalysis, I'll run `AnalyzeService.analyze_folder_standalone(folder, user)`, which provides crucial information. Then, I’ll build `project_data` for registration, ensuring to derive fields like `archive_id` from the folder name or default settings. I'll need to confirm any ambiguities with the user.
**Confirming registration process**

I’ve reviewed `analyze_service.py` and `project_manager.py`, and I’m ready to confirm the registration steps. First, I’ll discover candidate folders, analyze them if necessary, build the `project_data`, and finally register using `register_analyzed_folder_as_project`. I can also process the project to create rolls and allocate film numbers. 

Here are a few clarifying questions:  
- How should I derive `archive_id` and `location` from the folder path?  
- Should I call `process_project` or stop at registration?  
- What user should I attribute for ownership?  
- Are there specific base paths for scanning, and should I support `--dry-run`?  
- Do you want to register even if `.data` exists?  

I'll prepare a concise message with options for the management command.</details></think>

I reviewed the attached `analyze_service.py` and `project_manager.py` to map out the end-to-end flow. Here's what I understand and propose for the one-time command.

### What you want
- A non-interactive, one-time command that scans `X:\` for unregistered/available folders, analyzes them like the current analyze flow, then fully registers them as Projects and executes the registration steps automatically.

### Proposed registration steps
- **Discover candidates**: Reuse `AnalyzeService.discover_unregistered_folders(base_path="X:\\")` logic (exclusions, path normalization, DB checks against `AnalyzedFolder`) to find folders with no `.data` and not already analyzed/registered.
- **Analyze folder(s)**: For each candidate, run `AnalyzeService.analyze_folder_standalone(folder_path, user, force_reanalyze=False)` to compute pages, detect oversized, estimate rolls, recommend workflow, and store in `AnalyzedFolder`.
- **Prepare registration data**: Build `project_data` for each analyzed folder:
  - `archive_id`, `location`, `doc_type` (from your rules or defaults)
  - `project_path` (folder path), `project_folder_name` (folder name)
  - `comlist_path` (if available or empty), `output_dir` (default or from settings)
  - `retain_sources` (default True), `add_to_database` (default True)
  - `pdf_folder_path`, `has_pdf_folder` (from analysis)
- **Register project**: Call `AnalyzeService.register_analyzed_folder_as_project(analyzed_folder_id, project_data)` which creates the `Project` and links it back to the `AnalyzedFolder`.
- **Process project (optional but typical “registration step”)**:
  - Create rolls and allocate film numbers via `ProjectManager.process_project(project.id, allocate_film_numbers=True)`.
  - This sets status to `film_numbers_allocated`. We will not mark as completed.
- **Report**: Summarize how many candidates were found, analyzed, registered, and processed; include any failures.

### Clarifications to confirm
- **Archive ID derivation**: How should we compute `archive_id` from each folder? From folder name pattern, a mapping, or prompt default to folder name?
- **Location**: How do we derive `location` (and implicitly `location_code`)? Fixed value, inferred from path/name, or per-folder mapping?
- **Processing scope**: Do you want the command to go beyond registration and also run `process_project` (create rolls + allocate film numbers) now, or stop at registration?
- **Owner user**: Which `User` should be used for `analyzed_by` and project ownership? Provide a username (e.g., `admin`) or use the first superuser.
- **Base path**: Only `X:\` root, or a specific subfolder set?
- **Safety toggles**: OK to include `--dry-run`, `--force-reanalyze`, and `--limit N` options?
- **Skips**: Confirm we should skip folders that have a `.data` directory and those already present in `AnalyzedFolder`/registered projects.

If that aligns, I’ll implement a Django management command (e.g., `microapp.management.commands.register_projects_from_x`) with those options, using the services above and producing a concise summary at the end.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Confirming registration steps**

The user mentioned the registration process, indicating it may involve multiple steps like creating a Project record, importing analysis JSON into the database, rolling allocation creation, and allocating film numbers. The user also references a distribution manager, suggesting distribution may be part of this registration phase. I should clarify what steps should be included and ask about any optional ones. It's important to list these steps while referencing the appropriate services and functions, ensuring I align with the tool orchestration specifications.
**Clarifying task updates**

For read-only tasks, I don't need to include a to-do list, but the developer specification suggests we should provide status updates when tool calls are made. Since this message won't involve calling any tools, I can skip the status update. The user requested confirmation of steps, so I’ll present a step list based on earlier clarifications. I should mention the specifics in the attached code, like how the AnalyzeService discovers unregistered folders by filtering based on certain criteria.
**Detailing analysis process**

I see that the process begins with `analyze_service.analyze_folder_standalone`, which stores an 'AnalyzedFolder' in the database, containing file counts and analysis results like oversized detection and roll estimates. Then, `register_analyzed_folder_as_project` creates a project with various fields. Once registration is done, I might need to import documents, using `DocumentManager.bulk_import_documents` that requires a specific document list structure. It looks like I need a mapping step to convert the results for DocumentManager or adapt `film_number_manager._create_documents_from_analysis_data`, which has its own required structure.
**Clarifying analysis return structure**

The `_run_folder_analysis` function returns documents with fields like 'name', 'pages', 'has_oversized', and 'oversized_pages', but the 'path' may not be included; though analyzing the code reveals it actually does include 'path' in the `doc_result`. The returned analysis results are consistent. However, `FNM._create_documents_from_analysis_data` expects an 'analysisResults' key, while our service provides a simple dictionary. Thankfully, I can still directly call `DocumentManager.bulk_import_documents` with a properly constructed list of documents. 

Next, `RollManager.create_rolls_for_project` will handle roll creation for both regular and oversized documents. Finally, `FilmNumberManager.allocate_film_numbers` will allocate film numbers based on the existing FilmAllocation, processing both 16mm and 35mm formats.
**Outlining project registration process**

I see that `ReferenceManager.generate_reference_sheets` needs the film number allocation to be complete and for 35mm rolls to exist to generate blip mapping. Similarly, `DistributionManager.distribute_documents` requires `project.film_allocation_complete` to be true before it can copy documents. Since the user included `distribution_manager` in registration, they might want to handle both reference generation and distribution at that stage.

Next, I’ll update the Project fields, set `film_allocation_complete` and `distribution_complete` as true when distribution is done, and determine the use of `comlist_path` and `output_dir`.

Since the user wants a one-time script, I’ll propose a Django management command called `register_all_from_x` with various options. I should confirm several details with them, like archive_id derivation, location mapping, and whether to include distribution in registration, keeping everything simple and clear. Lastly, I must adhere to the required markdown formatting.</details></think>

I understand you want a non-interactive, one-time command that scans X:\, finds all remaining unregistered/available folders, analyzes them, registers them as Projects, and runs the full “registration” pipeline using your existing services.

### End-to-end registration steps I propose
- **Discovery (AnalyzeService)**:
  - Use `AnalyzeService.discover_unregistered_folders("X:\\")` to find folders without `.data` and not in `AnalyzedFolder`/`Project`.
  - For each folder, run `AnalyzeService.analyze_folder_standalone(folder_path, user)` to persist an `AnalyzedFolder` row with page counts, oversized detection, roll estimates, and `pdf_folder_path`.

- **Project creation (AnalyzeService → register)**:
  - Build `project_data` from folder/analysis:
    - `archive_id`, `location`, `doc_type`
    - `project_path`, `project_folder_name`
    - `comlist_path` (optional), `output_dir` (optional)
    - `retain_sources=True`, `add_to_database=True`
    - `pdf_folder_path`, `has_pdf_folder`
  - Call `AnalyzeService.register_analyzed_folder_as_project(analyzed_folder_id, project_data)` to create `Project` and link it.

- **Document ingest (DocumentManager)**:
  - Convert analysis docs to `DocumentManager.bulk_import_documents(project.id, document_list)` format:
    - For each doc: `doc_id`, `pages`, `path`, `is_oversized`, and `page_ranges` if available for oversized.

- **Initial roll setup (RollManager)**:
  - Run `RollManager.create_rolls_for_project(project.id)`:
    - Creates 16mm rolls from regular documents.
    - Creates 35mm `DocumentAllocationRequest35mm` entries for oversized docs.
    - Ensures a `FilmAllocation` record exists and updates roll stats.

- **Film numbers allocation (FilmNumberManager)**:
  - Run `FilmNumberManager.allocate_film_numbers(project.id)`:
    - Assigns film numbers to 16mm rolls (handles partials/temp rolls).
    - Processes 35mm allocation requests, creates 35mm rolls on-demand, generates blips, updates reference info.
    - Sets `project.film_allocation_complete = True`.

- **Reference sheet generation (ReferenceManager)**:
  - If `project.has_oversized`, generate reference sheets:
    - `ReferenceManager.generate_reference_sheets(project.id)` uses blips/rolls to create and save reference PDFs and database `ReferenceSheet` rows under `.temp/references`.

- **Distribution to output (DistributionManager)**:
  - With allocation complete, distribute files into `.output/<film_number>/…`:
    - `DistributionManager.distribute_documents(project.id)`:
      - 35mm: extract oversized, insert refs, copy processed PDFs to roll dirs.
      - 16mm: insert refs for mixed docs where needed, or copy regular PDFs as-is.
    - Updates `DistributionResult`, sets `project.distribution_complete = True`.

- **Project status progression (ProjectManager)**:
  - During processing, set `Project.status` through “new” → “in_progress” → “film_numbers_allocated”. We won’t mark “completed” unless you want that as part of this batch job.

### Inputs/assumptions I need from you
- **archive_id**: Derive from folder name or a rule? OK to default to the folder name?
- **location / location_code**: Single default for this run, or inferred per folder?
- **doc_type**: Default value to use (e.g., “DOCUMENT”)?
- **owner user**: Username to attribute as `analyzed_by` and project owner (e.g., `admin`)?
- **Scope**: Confirm we should include the final steps (reference generation + distribution) as part of “registration”. If not, we can stop after film number allocation.
- Optional flags: `--dry-run`, `--force-reanalyze`, `--limit N`, `--base "X:\"`.

If this matches your intent, I’ll implement a Django management command that executes these steps in sequence, with concise per-project summaries and a final report.
