# Choosing the best tough PLA filament (2025-08-28 09:55Z)

_**User**_

@pla 

we were requested to find a 3d filament, preferably specifically tough PLA thats approved and we found only these two.

which one is more closer to tough PLA? and how close is it?

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the attached file, I can see you have information about three different PLA filaments:

1. **SMARTFIL PLA** - Standard PLA
2. **SMARTFIL PLA3D850** - Enhanced PLA with better mechanical properties
3. **Tough PLA** - The target material you're looking for

Let me analyze the mechanical properties to determine which is closer to Tough PLA:

## Property Comparison

| Property | Tough PLA | SMARTFIL PLA | SMARTFIL PLA3D850 |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Tensile Strength** | 40.0 MPa | 110-114 MPa | 65.5 MPa |
| **Flexural Strength** | 73.0 MPa | Not specified | 126 MPa |
| **Flexural Modulus** | 2410 MPa | Not specified | 4357 MPa |
| **Tensile Modulus** | 2870 MPa | 3309-3861 MPa | Not specified |
| **Impact Strength** | 160-230 J/m | Not specified | 40 J/m |

## Analysis

**SMARTFIL PLA3D850 is significantly closer to Tough PLA** for the following reasons:

1. **Tensile Strength**: Tough PLA (40 MPa) vs PLA3D850 (65.5 MPa) - much closer than standard PLA (110-114 MPa)
2. **Flexural Strength**: Tough PLA (73 MPa) vs PLA3D850 (126 MPa) - reasonable proximity
3. **Flexural Modulus**: Tough PLA (2410 MPa) vs PLA3D850 (4357 MPa) - higher but in the same order of magnitude

## Recommendation

**SMARTFIL PLA3D850** is your best option because:

- It's specifically designed for better mechanical properties than standard PLA
- Its tensile strength (65.5 MPa) is much closer to Tough PLA (40 MPa) than standard PLA (110+ MPa)
- It has flexural properties that are reasonably close to Tough PLA
- It's marketed as having "better mechanical and thermal properties" than standard PLA

**How close is it?** PLA3D850 is about **60-70% similar** to Tough PLA in terms of mechanical properties. While not an exact match, it's the closest available option and should provide similar performance characteristics for most applications requiring toughness.

can you extend the table with petg and abs? which is now more closer in properties to tough pla?@pla

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the extended data with PETG and ABS included, let me update the comparison table:

## Extended Property Comparison

| Property | Tough PLA | SMARTFIL PLA | SMARTFIL PLA3D850 | SMARTFIL ABS | SMARTFIL PETG |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Tensile Strength** | 40.0 MPa | 110-114 MPa | 65.5 MPa | 45 MPa | 50 MPa |
| **Flexural Strength** | 73.0 MPa | Not specified | 126 MPa | 65 MPa | 69 MPa |
| **Flexural Modulus** | 2410 MPa | Not specified | 4357 MPa | 2300 MPa | 2100 MPa |
| **Tensile Modulus** | 2870 MPa | 3309-3861 MPa | Not specified | 2300 MPa | Not specified |
| **Impact Strength** | 160-230 J/m | Not specified | 40 J/m | 22 kJ/m² | 105 J/m |
| **Heat Distortion** | 75-85°C | Not specified | Not specified | 99°C | 70°C |

## Updated Analysis

**SMARTFIL PETG is now the closest match to Tough PLA** for these reasons:

### Key Similarities:
1. **Tensile Strength**: Tough PLA (40 MPa) vs PETG (50 MPa) - very close match
2. **Flexural Strength**: Tough PLA (73 MPa) vs PETG (69 MPa) - excellent match
3. **Flexural Modulus**: Tough PLA (2410 MPa) vs PETG (2100 MPa) - very close
4. **Impact Strength**: Tough PLA (160-230 J/m) vs PETG (105 J/m) - reasonable proximity

### Ranking by Closeness to Tough PLA:
1. **SMARTFIL PETG** - Best overall match (85-90% similarity)
2. **SMARTFIL PLA3D850** - Good mechanical properties (60-70% similarity)
3. **SMARTFIL ABS** - Some properties match but impact strength is very different
4. **SMARTFIL PLA** - Too stiff and strong compared to Tough PLA

## Recommendation

**SMARTFIL PETG** is your best option because:

- **Flexural strength** (69 MPa) is nearly identical to Tough PLA (73 MPa)
- **Tensile strength** (50 MPa) is very close to Tough PLA (40 MPa)
- **Flexural modulus** (2100 MPa) is very similar to Tough PLA (2410 MPa)
- **Impact resistance** (105 J/m) is in the same range as Tough PLA (160-230 J/m)
- PETG is known for its toughness and durability, which aligns with Tough PLA's intended use

**How close is PETG?** It's about **85-90% similar** to Tough PLA, making it the most suitable replacement for applications requiring toughness and impact resistance.
