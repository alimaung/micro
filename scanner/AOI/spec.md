Inspection and Quality Guidelines for Reproduced Microfilm Documents 


# Common Faults

**Original Document (digital)**

When creating digital or scanning paper documents to PDF, common human errors/machine misconfiguration(scanner) 

- Rotation/Scaling
- Brightness/Contrast
- Physical (creases)
- Missing pages/source document mistakes (impossible to detect, like customer forgot to add pages etc., faults that are out of our hands, but we dont focus on these)

**Microfilm (physical)** 

- Exposure: (actual filming operation inside machine)
    1. Overexposure (too slow shutter speed)
    2. Underexposure (too high shutter speed)
    3. Misconfiguration/Errors (machine fails to feed trailer, crashes)

- Development:
    1. High density (e.g. too high temp)
    2. Low density (e.g too low developer solution)
    3. Unwanted Exposure (e.g. opening the hatch)

- Handling: (When handling undeveloped rolls (between processes))
    1. Unwanted Exposure
    3. Scratches/Physical

For archival microfilm, the most critical failures (highest Severity) often relate to:

1. Chemical Processing Failures: Incomplete fixing or washing (residual thiosulfate), which leads to image degradation and loss of archival longevity. This is a catastrophic failure for a permanent record.

2. Density/Focus Failures: Unreadable or poor-quality images which mean the record is not a suitable substitute for the original.

These critical areas are where control measures and strict adherence to international standards (like ISO standards) are paramount.

**Reproduction (digital)** 

After development, the microfilm is digitized using a microfilm scanner, producing PDF versions of the original documents. 
Since it relies on image processing, the resulting document is slightly different from the original

- Scanning:
    1. Misconfiguration (brightness/contrast doesnt match)
    2. Rotation/Orientation (PDF has margins, is rotated etc.)

- Handling: (When handling developed rolls)
    3. Scratches/Physical
